                    <p>Hello, my name is Krish and I’m a student studying Computer Science at Georgia Tech with a focus on intelligence algorithms and systems/architecture. Since the start of high school, I’ve been interested in how software can be used to create faster, smarter, and more efficient physical systems. I applied this interest in the FRC robotics competition, FSAE electric vehicle competition, and various personal projects. Check out the experience tab to see some of the cool stuff I worked on!</p>
